      <h1>What you should eat to get bigger :</h1>
      <p>
        Most men are aware of the importance of protein in muscular development. When understanding , the strain of weight lifting damages muscle fibers. This damage triggers a unique healing mechanism that drives individual muscle cells to develop. All of this growth requires a lot of amino acids, the essential building blocks of life.

But the method of muscle growth requires quite just protein. Weight lifting burns fat and energy within the sort of muscle glycogen, so your diet also must include a healthy serving of carbs to both replenish muscle glycogen stores and to spice up insulin, a hormone that helps shuttle amino acids into the muscles. this suggests you ought to not only specialise in incorporating protein into your diet, but also pay even as much attention to avoiding unhealthy foods – this mix of attention to your diet are going to be a winning combo. <br>

So, which foods assist you build muscle?<br>

Well, AskMen has already explored foods make the simplest post-workout meal also because the best pre-workout food, so during this piece, we’ve decided to specialise in which specific foods pack the most important protein punch.
<br>

The top ten meals for muscle development are listed below. <br>

<h2>1/- Quinoa :</h2> <br>

Reality check: Not all men eat meat. But without meat, how are you able to get that precious protein? Look no further than quinoa, a protein-rich South American grain. Quinoa is not only high in protein, but it also provides complete protein, which means it includes all nine necessary amino acids. Additionally, this gluten-free meal is easy to digest and abundant in fiber, magnesium, and iron. No wonder the traditional Incas called quinoa the mother of all grains! <br>

<h2>2/- Almonds :</h2> <br>

Almonds are another plant-based food absolutely packed filled with protein. A quarter cup of almonds has almost 8 grams of protein, which is nearly 2 grams more than an egg! Almonds also are a superb source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and magnesium. Magnesium is an abundant mineral that’s utilized in quite 300 biochemical reactions within the body and is specifically known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.
 <br>

<h2>3/- pot cheese :</h2>
 <br>
It may sound surprising, but most serious bodybuilders include pot cheese among their top muscle-building foods. to know why, simply read the label of your typical low-fat or fat-free pot cheese . Just 1/2 cup of low-fat pot cheese packs a whopping 14 grams of protein in just 80 calories with but 2 grams of fat. Trust us, this one’s a winner. <br>

<h2>4/- Oysters :</h2>
<br>
Oysters are another hidden speciality of weight lifters and bodybuilders alike, despite not being the most well-known muscle-building meal. Cooked Pacific oysters provide up to 20 grams of protein and only five grams of fat per 100 grams. Oysters also provide more zinc than the other food. Like magnesium, zinc  is required for protein synthesis, making oysters an excellent muscle-building meal.
<br>
<h2>5/- milk :</h2>
<br>
Men have been informed of the necessity of milk to a growing body since we were little lads. But whilst adult males, milk remains even as important. Because milk is an animal food, it provides all the essential amino acids while offering little or no fat (especially skim milk). Milk's muscle-building benefits are amplified by the fact that it combines so well with whey protein. Just take a glance at Shamrock Farms Rockin’ Refuel -- which packs 20 grams of protein in one hundred pc real milk in delicious chocolate, strawberry and vanilla flavors -- if you would like a major example of a great-tasting, muscle-building beverage.
<br>
<h2>6/- Lean beef :</h2>
<br>
Red meats, like lean beef , are a superb source of protein, so completely avoiding them due to the "red" stigma could be an error . Just 100 grams of lean hamburger contains upward of 27 grams of protein! Despite the fact that such a serving is heavy in fat (11 grams of fat and roughly 200 calories), what sets beef apart from its other meat competitors is the abundance of vitamins and minerals it carries. Beef is high in vitamin B12, zinc, and iron, all of which are essential for muscular development and growth.
<br>
<h2>6. Soy :</h2>
<br>
The muscle-building properties of the soybean, whether given as edamame, tofu, or soy milk, simply cannot be matched by any other plant source. together of the few plant sources that provide complete protein, soy packs its protein a la mode . only one cup of cooked soybeans contains over 20 grams of amino acids. Soy is also abundant in other important vitamins and minerals, making it one of the most nutritious muscle-building foods available.
<br>
<h2>7/- Eggs :</h2>
<br>
Quick and straightforward to organize , delicious and fun to eat, eggs are a key dietary component of any muscle-minded male. Each egg comes loaded with around five to 6 grams of protein at the very low caloric cost of only 60 calories. But it’s not just the quantity of protein that creates eggs so special, it’s also the type: Egg protein is taken into account to be the foremost readily utilizable protein with the very best biological value of any whole food. this suggests that the protein in eggs is employed most efficiently for muscular growth.
<br>
<h2>8/- Chicken : </h2>
<br>
What can we are saying about chicken that hasn’t already been said? Chicken is that the staple muscle-building food. A nice, lean 100-gram slab of this red meat will fill you with a hearty serving of 31 grams of protein with only -- await it -- four grams of fat. So, as far as protein-to-fat ratio cares , you’re watching somebody . When you consider chicken's wonderful taste and meal flexibility, it's easy to see why it's one of the best muscle-building meals.
<br>
<h2>9/- Fish :</h2>
<br>
Fish outperforms the competition when it comes to muscle development. Take salmon, for instance . Salmon is not just a protein powerhouse, with about 25 grams of protein per 100-gram meal, but it's also packed with so many other beneficial elements that you'd be a fool to pass it up.. Salmon is high in monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, both of which are good for your heart. It’s also a superb source of vitamin D , a current media darling. beat all, fish, like tuna or salmon, are simply the simplest .
